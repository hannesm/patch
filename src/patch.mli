  (** The operation of a diff: in-place [Edit], [Delete], [Create].
      And its git-extensions: [Rename_only], [Delete_only], [Create_only].
      The parameters to the variants are filenames.

      Note that [Edit] also renames the given file under certain conditions
      and the file to use is driven by this POSIX rule:
      https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9799919799/utilities/patch.html#tag_20_92_13_02

      Note also that the two filenames in [Git_ext] represent what would be
      in [git --diff <filename1> <filename2>] with their respective prefixes
      removed if parsed with [parse ~p:1] or above.

      Warning: The two parameters of [Rename_only] represent the values of the
      [rename from <filename1>] and [rename to <filename2>] following the
      specs of the git extensions. Following the behaviour of GNU Patch which
      ignores these two lines, it is recommended to get the filenames from
      [Git_ext] instead of from [Rename_only], which are used only for
      pretty-printing. *)
